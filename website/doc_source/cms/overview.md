Overview
========

This builder targets the very popular [Bootstrap3] framework. Wakanda’s
Designer is used for building up forms and components from specifically
designed custom widgets and for creating and hooking up application
logic. A series of abstractions (themes, meta data, templating, etc) is
used by the builder to compile to production pages and code.

Overcomes various Wakanda issues:

-   Fixed layout
-   Lack of design constraints
-   Clunky navigation
-   Having to adapt Wakanda widgets in unintended ways
-   Lots of widgets on pages resulting in slow and buggy development
    experience

Core benefits:

-   **Fluid and responsive layouts**: create one interface for mobile,
    table and desktop
-   **Theme based look and feel**: take the design power away from the
    programmer and give to the designer…look consistent, modern and
    great!
-   **Rapid widget creation approach (“light” widgets)**: most widgets
    don’t need to be kitchen sinks
-   **Merges single-page application and website features**: ever wished
    your SPA’s could have the depth of a website? ever wished your
    websites could have the powerful interactions of a SPA?
-   **Reporting**: a page can just as easily be a report as an app or
    website
