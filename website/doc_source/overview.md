## How to think in programming tiers

> How we take apps from idea to reality


**Goal:** teach how to think then show how to implement. If start with this
process from beginning, informs each stage for scope, expectations, and
cost. Also keeps you from jumping right to high risk cost stage when you
donâ€™t need it right away.

#### Tier 1: An idea

Mock it up, twist it around. See if worth pursuing.

- _Tool:_ low-fidelity prototype  
- _Cost:_ low risk

#### Tier 2: Functional prototype

Touch, feel, see. See if you still like it, adjust minor to majorly,
throw it away, test with core users

- _Tool:_ high fidelity prototype  
- _Cost:_ medium risk

#### Tier 3: Minimal viable product

- _Tools:_ high fidelity prototype, more advanced tech approach, or a
hybrid  
- _Cost:_ high risk  
   
 

Features
--------

#### 1. Core

A modular approach to solution development with a core set of projects
that provide functionality for security, routing and other common
application tasks.

*Get right to developing your business application.*  
 

#### 2. APIs

API-driven development that organizes server-side code around business
objects.

*Detangle your business logic from across a multitude of data structure
events.*

   
#### 3. Logic Layers

Event and data flow through explicitly defined logic layers enables
Wakanda projects to act autonomously, share data and services to other
projects in a solution, be developed and maintained independently of the
current solution, and even be connected/shared across multiple
solutions.

*Scale up to large solutions with minimal spaghetti code.*  
 

#### 4. UIs

Template approach to UI development with builders, custom widgets, and a
form layout designer for advanced client frameworks such as Bootstrap
that isolates the design tasks away from the development process.

*Look great and output responsive SPA, dashboard, CMS, and reporting
interfaces to any device with one UI code base.*
